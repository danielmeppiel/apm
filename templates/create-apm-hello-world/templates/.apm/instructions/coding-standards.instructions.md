# Coding Standards

Follow these coding standards for all code in this project:

## General Principles

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages

## Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (project-specific)
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters)
- Group related code together
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections

## Documentation

- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
